# OwlEval

We have compiled some examples and their corresponding questions from recent open-source work, and organized them into OwlEval.

Following we will introduce the OwlEval and the data format in this document.

## Data Format

### questions

`questions.jsonl` contains case images and information about their corresponding questions

Each row contains the following field:

- `image`: Indicate the name of the picture
- `question_id`: Indicate the question id number, there are 82 questions

- `question`: Represent specific problem information
- `ability`: Represent the required abilities of the model. Detailed definiton can be found in paper.
  - `a` is `Instruction Understanding`
  - `b` is `Visual Understanding`
  - `c` is `Optical Character Recognition`
  - `d` is `Knowledge Transfer Ability`
  - `e` is `Reasoning Ability`
  - `f` is `Multi-turn Dialogue Ability`
- `category`ï¼šIndicate whether the problem is a single-turn problem or a multi-turn problem

For example:

```json
{"image": "1.jpg", "question_id": 1, "question": "What is funny about this image? Describe it panel by panel.", "ability": "a,b,e", "category": ["single_turn"]}
```

### answer

This contains the responses of each model for each question, integrated into six jsonl:

`llava_13b_answer.jsonl`

`minigpt4_13b_answer.jsonl`

`MMreact_answer.jsonl`

`mPLUG_Owl_7b_answer.jsonl`

`BLIP2_13b_answer.jsonl`

`openflamingo_answer.jsonl`

For each `answer/xxx.jsonl` it contains the following information:

- `image`: Indicate the name of the picture
- `question_id`: Indicate the question id number, there are 82 questions

- `question`: Represent specific problem information
- `answer`: Replie given by the model
- `model_id`: The ID of the model the answer is generated by

For example:
