# Mistral

## Overview

Mistral-7B-v0.1 is Mistral AI's first Large Language Model (LLM). 

### Model Details

Mistral-7B-v0.1 is a decoder-based LM with the following architectural choices:
* Sliding Window Attention - Trained with 8k context length and fixed cache size, with a theoretical attention span of 128K tokens
* GQA (Grouped Query Attention) - allowing faster inference and lower cache size.
* Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer - ensures that characters are never mapped to out of vocabulary tokens.

We also provide an instruction fine-tuned model: `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` which can be used for chat-based inference.

For more details please read our [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/)

### License

Both `Mistral-7B-v0.1` and `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Usage tips

`Mistral-7B-v0.1` and `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/mistralai)

These ready-to-use checkpoints can be downloaded and used via the HuggingFace Hub:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
>>> device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

>>> prompt = "My favourite condiment is"

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to(device)
>>> model.to(device)

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"The expected output"
```

Raw weights for `Mistral-7B-v0.1` and `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` can be downloaded from:

| Model Name                 | Checkpoint                                                                              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Mistral-7B-v0.1`          | [Raw Checkpoint](https://files.mistral-7b-v0-1.mistral.ai/mistral-7B-v0.1.tar)          |
| `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` | [Raw Checkpoint](https://files.mistral-7b-v0-1.mistral.ai/mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1.tar) |


To use these raw checkpoints with HuggingFace you can use the `convert_mistral_weights_to_hf.py` script to convert them to the HuggingFace format:

```bash
python src/transformers/models/mistral/convert_mistral_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/mistral/weights --model_size 7B --output_dir /output/path
```

You can then load the converted model from the `output/path`:

```python
from transformers import MistralForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("/output/path")
model = MistralForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/output/path")
```

## Combining Mistral and Flash Attention 2

First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2 to include the sliding window attention feature.

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Make also sure that you have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of [`flash-attn`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) repository. Make also sure to load your model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16`)

To load and run a model using Flash Attention 2, refer to the snippet below:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
>>> device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

>>> prompt = "My favourite condiment is"

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to(device)
>>> model.to(device)

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"The expected output"
```

### Expected speedups

Below is a expected speedup diagram that compares pure inference time between the native implementation in transformers using `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1` checkpoint and the Flash Attention 2 version of the model.

### Sliding window Attention

The current implementation supports the sliding window attention mechanism and memory efficient cache management. 
To enable sliding window attention, just make sure to have a `flash-attn` version that is compatible with sliding window attention (`>=2.3.0`). 

The Flash Attention-2 model uses also a more memory efficient cache slicing mechanism - as recommended per the official implementation of Mistral model that use rolling cache mechanism we keep the cache size fixed (`self.config.sliding_window`), support batched generation only for `padding_side="left"` and use the absolute position of the current token to compute the positional embedding.
